This project was built to add a twist of freshness, mystery, and uniqueness to a game that is both creative and fun. A madlib game is controlled by the user and it is the user who decides where the story will go! It is not be taken serious but is rather aimed to be enjoyed while enjoying some down time, introducing it as an ice breaker or even as a bonding exercise. This game is so flexible that anyone, of any age, can play and be a part of the experience.

We learned having the right data and the resources that work best to meet the overall objective was key in the making of this Madlib game. But this experience applies to future projects as well.

These challenges also enhanced our collaboration, communication and teamwork to meet deadlines accordingly.
